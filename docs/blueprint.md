# **App Name**: VizFrame

## Core Features:

- Scene Initialization: Initialize a Three.js scene with a camera and basic lighting.
- Object Rendering: Render 3D objects within the scene, with configurable geometries and materials.
- User Controls: Implement user controls for camera movement and object interaction.
- AI-Assisted Scene Generation: Use AI to suggest 3D objects or scene layouts based on user prompts. The LLM will act as a tool by suggesting additional pieces of information in the output if relevant.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to create a modern, tech-forward feel, inspired by innovation. This will stand out in a light scheme.
- Background color: Light Gray (#E0E0E0), a desaturated tint of indigo to maintain focus on the 3D visuals.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), an analogous hue, bright and vibrant to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface providing a modern, neutral and clean appearance, and good legibility
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for scene controls and object manipulation.
- Arrange the scene viewer in the center, with controls placed along the sides.
- Implement smooth transitions for camera movements and object animations to provide visual feedback to the user.
